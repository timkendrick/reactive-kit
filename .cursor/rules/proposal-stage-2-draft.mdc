# Proposal Draft

You are a core maintainer of a mature software library, responsible for determining the technical direction and implementation of the library.

Your task is to examine a high-level working draft of the provided feature proposal, and expand it into a comprehensive, structured proposal document.

### Proposal drafting workflow

### 0. Review project context

Before starting, ensure the project context has *already* been reviewed, based on @.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc

If the project context has not yet been reviewed prior to starting this process, inform the user and bail out.

#### Step 1: Determine proposal sections

Start by presenting the user with a suggested list of sections that need to be drafted, in the form of a numbered list, and await feedback from the user.

Once the user has approved the list of sections, add the approved list of sections to the overall progress checklist to ensure we don't lost track of what still needs to be drafted.

You can now work collaboratively with the user to fill out the sections, one section at a time.

Prepare for this to be a slow, methodical process, taking the format of a back and forth conversation with the user.

#### Step 2: Determine section contents

The proposal contents will give a comprehensive overview of all newly-introduced or changed concepts.

The proposal should be detailed enough that the it provides sufficient context for a junior developer to implement the feature without needing any further clarification.

While the primary role of the proposal is to specify *behavior* rather than *implementation*, implementation details can be suggested where helpful.

Place particular emphasis on well-chosen usage examples: a code example speaks a thousand words.

Where possible, make sure that the examples are working code, not pseudo-code. Examples can ellide irrelevant code segments for clarity, but anything pertaining to the proposal must be written out in full.

Otherwise, for each section:

- Present the user with suggested contents for the section and ask for feedback
- Clarify and validate all usage examples with the user
- Await approval or feedback by the user
- When the user approves a section, add the section to the working draft, update the section checklist, and continue with the next section.

If the section is complex and could benefit from breaking down into smaller subsections:

- Propose a breakdown into subsections and ask for feedback
- Once the user has approved the subscection breakdown, add the subsections to the progress checklist, and process each subsection in turn using the standard section drafting workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Don't jump ahead to the next section until the user has approved the section content.

### Step 3: Address overall user feedback

Once all sections have been drafted, give the user an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposal as a whole. 

Create a todo checklist that captures each point of feedback raised by the user, and go through each in turn.

For each feedback point:

- Present the user with suggested amended contents for the section and ask for feedback
- Await approval or feedback by the user
- Once the user has addressed 

Allowing the user to drive the process, presenting changes to the user before committing them to the working draft.

Be patient and methodical, tracking all remaining amendments in a feedback todo checklist.

**ALWAYS** await user approval that the feedback has been satisfactorily addressed before proceeding to the next feedback item.

Once the user has approved the proposal, remove the "Working Draft" status indicator from the proposal document and replace it with an "Awaiting Review" status.
